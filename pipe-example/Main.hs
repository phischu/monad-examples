{-| We have a stream of messages. A message consists of a user's name
    (the sender), the message content and a time stamp. We want to
    limit the number of messages to at most one message per three seconds.

    Add a pipe that blacklists a user with a given user name. It should drop
    all messages from that user.
    Compose it either before or after rate limiting and observe the result.
