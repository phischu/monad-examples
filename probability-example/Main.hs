{-| You have two six-sided dice. You roll them and add five to their sum.
    Your enemy has two twenty-sided dice. He rolls both and takes the maximum.
    What is your chance of scoring higher than your enemy?

    You can extend the code to the following scenario:
    Now you have two enemies, what is your chance of scoring higher than both?
