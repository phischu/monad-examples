{-| We have a file named filenames that contains a newline-delimited list of
    filenames. We want to count the total number of lines in all listed files
    and write that count to a file named linecount. If we rerun we want to
    avoid any unnecessary work.

    You could add *.count files that remember the line counts of
    individual files.
